                    <h4>Acceptance</h4>
                    <p>We acknowledge that the universe unfolds according to principles beyond our comprehension. Every moment carries the weight of infinite possibilities, each equally valid, each equally transient. In accepting this, we free ourselves from the burden of false certainty.</p>

                    <div class="pillar-icon">⚛</div>
                    <h4>Flow</h4>
                    <p>Like water finding its path through stone, we learn to move with the currents of chance rather than against them. Resistance breeds suffering; acceptance breeds serenity. The river does not fight its course—it simply flows, and in flowing, shapes the world.</p>

                    <h4>Unity</h4>
                    <p>Before the great randomness, all distinctions dissolve. Fortune and misfortune touch all lives without discrimination. In this universal uncertainty, we find our deepest connection—we are all particles dancing in the same cosmic probability field.</p>

                    <p>What must happen will happen. What might happen might not. The beauty lies not in controlling outcomes, but in finding grace within whatever unfolds. Each moment is both inevitable and impossible—a paradox that frees us from anxiety.</p>

                <div class="teaching-card">
                    <h5>On Meaning</h5>
                    <p>Meaning is not discovered in the random; it is created despite it. We are meaning-makers in a meaningless cosmos, artists painting purpose upon the canvas of chaos. This is not tragedy—this is our greatest power.</p>

                    <h5>On Suffering</h5>
                    <p>Pain arrives randomly, as does joy. Neither is deserved, neither is punishment. To accept this is to free oneself from the tyranny of "why me?" The storm does not choose whom it strikes—it simply is. So too with all of life's trials.</p>

                    <h6>The Principle of Probability</h6>
                    <p>All events exist in a state of potential until they occur. We honor the multiplicity of possible futures and do not cling to any single outcome. In releasing attachment to specific results, we embrace all possibilities equally.</p>

                    <div class="principle-number">II</div>
                    <h6>The Principle of Equanimity</h6>
                    <p>Fortune and misfortune are two faces of the same coin, spinning eternally through the air. We greet both with equal calm, knowing that neither state is permanent and neither is personal. The wise person remains centered through all changes.</p>

                    <div class="principle-number">III</div>
                    <h6>The Principle of Surrender</h6>
                    <p>Control is the sweetest illusion and the source of deepest suffering. We surrender not to defeat, but to reality. In this surrender, we discover a profound freedom—the freedom to be fully present with what is, rather than consumed by what we wish could be.</p>

                    <h6>The Principle of Interconnection</h6>
                    <p>Every event ripples outward in patterns beyond comprehension. A butterfly's wing, a child's laugh, a star's death—all connected in the great web of chance and consequence. We are not isolated actors but threads in an infinite tapestry.</p>
